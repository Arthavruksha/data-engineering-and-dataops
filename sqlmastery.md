# SQL Mastery Guide

As first-year students, the best approach to mastering SQL is through hands-on experience, followed by certification. Here are some resources recommended for the Fall semester. Ideally, you should explore these resources and practice on interactive labs to identify and improve weak areas before the semester starts. These resources will also serve as useful references throughout the year.
