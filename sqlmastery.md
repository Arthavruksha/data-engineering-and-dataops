**Pathway to SQL Mastery**

For first year students the recommendation to master SQL is to “learn by doing”, then get certified.  Here are recommended resources to use as resources for the Fall semester.  Ideally you have browsed these resources and found areas of weakness to practice on using these interactive labs before the start of the Fall term.  Later in the first year, these resources will be a great reference source as you take other classes.

Towards the end of the first semester, I recommend students get certified on Databricks.  This will allow you to be successful in the practicum and also give you an edge in doing internships.  This certification also allows you to prove you know how to apply SQL to real-world problems.

**Recommended SQL Related Certifications**
