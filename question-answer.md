### Cloud

Q:  How do ports and networking work with applications like Flask, FastAPI and AWS.  This is a very confusing topic, clarify for me.

### MLOps

Q:  I am a Data Scientist and am learning data engineering to meet market demand. Do I start learning cloud and MLOPs?

Q:  Thanks a lot for the superb presentation. Could you please share any specific MLOps processes for the recommendation system (item-item + user-user)?

Q: What skills and resources does an organization need to implement an MLOps environment? Thanks

Q: What are the MLOps tools and platform options for Enterprise AI use cases that involve sensitive enterprise data that can't be ported to a public cloud?

Q: You spoke earlier about how Data science roles are too specific, and so the demand for these roles is reducing, while we are seeing the need for Data Engineers or ML Engineers increasing. Do you think there isn't a place for Data Scientists anymore, and do you think a Data Scientist has the necessary skills to step into what an ML Engineer can deliver? 

Q:  Also, what do you think the distinction is between an ML Engineer and a Data Analyst role? If you see a difference, how do you know the interdependency of these roles interacting?

Q: Could you use a Jupyter Notebook to run on different servers?  One of the slides seems to imply that.  Could you provide an example?  Thanks.

Q: If an organization would like to implement MLOps from a traditional-based data analytics structure. Does the organization need to undertake a fundamental organizational restructuring driven by the agility of MLOps?

Q: Should companies create an MLOps Engineer role? Or do you think it is more a collective responsibility where multiple roles should learn MLOps practices? Which current professional position (ML Eng., Data Sci., DevOps Eng., etc.) do you think is the most suitable to promote and apply MLOps practices?

Q: do you think the likes of AWS/Azure/GCP will completely replace things like SAS and R for developing ML processes? 

Q: what is the best way to deploy Apache Spark-based models to edge where Spark isn't available? Containerization?

Q:  ​​For beginners in Data Science, what do we need to learn to build an MLOps similar to your GitHub repo demo?

Q:  It seems MLOps for different cloud companies is different; can you say something about that?

Q:  How different is it for deploying written code in C++ vs. python?

Q:  In terms of CI/CD Build, must we only test the code itself? or the performance of the ML models we are delivering as well?

Q:  What are the use cases in banking and finance for MLOps?

Q:  As a data analyst looking to move into data science, how important is it to learn more about cloud-based environments and ML Ops

Q:  What Cloud do you recommend to learn first to do MLOps? Aws, Azure, Google Cloud, ...?

Q:  What is the difference in learning MLOps using the Big tech proprietary applications and open source applications?

Q:  Can the MLOps platform be configured to self train itself when the data drift reaches a pre-defined threshold and send a notification to a user group
