### Course Description

Data Engineering is applied software engineering.  It is not data science, or computer science.  As a result this is focused on building software systems within the domain of data.
This course covers servers as a method of encapsulating many courses in the program.  Students learn to apply Data Engineering to a real-world project.  This manifests itself through several goals:  development of non-linear life-long learning, community building, portfolio development, and software engineering best practices including using AI Pair Programming assistances, DevOps and Cloud Computing.

## Course Goals

Upon course completion, you'll be able to:

* Create data engineering solutions using Rust and the Linux environment.
* Design binary executables for interfacing with SQL systems such as Snowflake, DataBricks, and BigQuery.
* Construct robust, efficient, and safe systems with low carbon footprints, leveraging the inherent properties of Rust for scalable efficiency.
* Use AI Pair Programming tools like GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, AWS CodeWhisperer, and Google Bard for building sophisticated, reliable systems.
* Cultivate non-linear, lifelong learning skills.
* Assemble, share, and present persuasive portfolios using platforms like GitHub, YouTube, and LinkedIn.
* Obtain certifications in Cloud Computing and a Big Data SQL solution.

### Prerequisites 

Basic programming skills as well as basic linux skills.  See optional readings/media to self-learn before class starts.
