### Course Description

Data Engineering is applied software engineering.  It is not data science, or computer science.  As a result this is focused on building software systems within the domain of data.
This course covers servers as a method of encapsulating many courses in the program.  Students learn to apply Data Engineering to a real-world project.  This manifests itself through several goals:  development of non-linear life-long learning, community building, portfolio development, and software engineering best practices including using AI Pair Programming assistances, DevOps and Cloud Computing.

## Course Goals

Upon course completion, you'll be able to:

* Create data engineering solutions using Rust and the Linux environment.
* Design binary executables for interfacing with SQL systems such as Snowflake, DataBricks, and BigQuery.
* Construct robust, efficient, and safe systems with low carbon footprints, leveraging the inherent properties of Rust for scalable efficiency.
* Use AI Pair Programming tools like GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, AWS CodeWhisperer, and Google Bard for building sophisticated, reliable systems.
* Cultivate non-linear, lifelong learning skills.
* Assemble, share, and present persuasive portfolios using platforms like GitHub, YouTube, and LinkedIn.
* Obtain certifications in Cloud Computing and a Big Data SQL solution.


### Prerequisites 

Basic programming skills as well as basic linux skills.  See optional readings/media to self-learn before class starts.

### Diversity Statement

We, as educators and students, are dedicated to fostering diversity and equity, ensuring everyone's full participation by eliminating educational obstacles. This course values the diverse experiences, backgrounds, identities, learning styles, and academic interests of each individual. The array of perspectives from our students enriches all, and we aim to approach each with openness and respect.

#### Late Work Policy 

Late work will be accepted only in the event of an instructor-approved absence. Contact your instructor as soon as possible, at least 24 hours in advance.

### Online Communication and Interaction Expectations
#### Discussion Forums 

The purpose of the discussion boards is to allow students to freely exchange ideas. It is imperative to remain respectful of all viewpoints and positions and, when necessary, agree to respectfully disagree. While active and frequent participation is encouraged, cluttering a discussion board with inappropriate, irrelevant, or insignificant material will not earn additional points and may result in receiving less than full credit. Frequency matters, but contributing content that adds value is paramount. Please remember to cite all sources—when relevant—in order to avoid plagiarism. Please post your viewpoints first and then discuss others’ viewpoints. 

The quality of your posts and how others view and respond to them are the most valued. A single statement mostly implying “I agree” or “I do not agree” is not counted as a post. Explain, clarify, politely ask for details, provide details, persuade, and enrich communications for a great discussion experience. Please note, there is a requirement to respond to at least two fellow class members’ posts. Also, remember to cite all sources—when relevant—in order to avoid plagiarism.



#### Online Communication Etiquette

Beyond interacting with your instructor and peers in discussions, you will be expected to communicate by Teams message, email, and sync session. Your instructor may also make themselves available by phone or text. In all contexts, keep your communication professional and respect the instructor’s posted availability. 

Just as you expect a response when you send a message to your instructor, please respond promptly when your instructor contacts you. Your instructor will expect a response within two business days. This will require that you log into the course site regularly and set up your notifications to inform you when the instructor posts an announcement, provides feedback on work or sends you a message. 

#### Participation and Attendance 

This course will meet at a particular time each week. Additioanlly, all course goals, session learning objectives, and assessments are supported through classroom elements that can be accessed at any time. To measure class participation (or attendance), your participation in threaded discussion boards is required, graded, and important to your success in this course. Please note that any scheduled synchronous meetings are REQUIRED. 

### Course Technology

This course will involve a number of different types of interactions. These interactions will take place primarily through Microsoft Teams, GitHub and Zoom. Please take the time to navigate through the course and become familiar with the course syllabus, structure, and content and review the list of resources below. 

#### Required Technical Skills

Students in an online program should be able to do the following: 

* Communicate via Teams discussion forums.
* Use web browsers and navigate the World Wide Web and use tools like ChatGPT.
* Use the learning management system Teams.
* Use GitHub
* Create demo videos
* Write Rust code
* Use Cloud Computing and Cloud Computing Labs
